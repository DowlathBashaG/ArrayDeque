# ArrayDeque

ArrayDeque ....it is used as stack or queue.

    If you are using "add" method it is Stack , if you are using "offer" method it will react like Queue.


Note:

    if you add values in the queue....using "offer" method  the value is not there it will through NullPointerException. If you use "add" it is not throughing.
	
	So use better way to add method.
